Except for political pundits, general politics doesn't belong on Twitter. It's of little value to followers and is a negative to most [1]. The Hacker News guideline, ["If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic"](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html), applies to Twitter too.

I had to stop following [@paulg](https://twitter.com/paulg) because he posts too many political items. I disagree with many of his opinions and agree with some. But whether I agree or not is irrelevant. His tweets on general politics are negative for me because most are of negative news e.g. [2]. There's exceptions such as his raising awareness of a death penalty case, which was good [3].
