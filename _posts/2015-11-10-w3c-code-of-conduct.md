Compare the [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) and the soon to be [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/13073-code-of-conduct.md). One is human and one is not. In [Flowers for Algernon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers_for_Algernon) which is more applicable?

People are not widgets they're humans.

An example from YouTube, [Don't Talk to Cops, Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08fZQWjDVKE&t=9m41s) (9m41s-10m14s). The speaker shows an understanding of what's innately demeaning.

In the proposed Go Community Code of Conduct, part of one of the examples says: "S reports the incident to the CoC Working Group" (about J). At this point how does J feel? Respected or demeaned and insulted (the incident details are unimportant). I've seen it go both ways, some were handled like the speaker in the YouTube clip and some not.

Read how the example ends. At the conclusion of the example, if I was J, I'd feel aweful,  humiliated and insignificant. That's no way to treat anyone.
