Compare the [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) and the soon to be [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/13073-code-of-conduct.md). One is human and one is not. In [Flowers for Algernon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers_for_Algernon) which is more applicable?

People are not widgets they're humans, Flowers for Algernon shows what it means to be human.
