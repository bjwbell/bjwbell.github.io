Is Moore's Law Over?

I think Intel's recent annoucement of a ~1 year delay to their 10nm architecture, Skylake, indicates that Moore's Law is at least severely strained.

Intel's previous 14nm architecture, Broadwell, was also delayed by 6 months.


Moore's Law has never been a physical given. It's observation due at least partly to the economics of process node shrintage.
