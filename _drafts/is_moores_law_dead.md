Is Moore's Law Over?

Moore's Law has never been a physical given. It's observation due at least partly to economics.

The problems with Moore's Law first appeared a few years ago with Nvidia's 40nm to 28nm transition. Nvidia put out a presentation,
http://www.extremetech.com/computing/123529-nvidia-deeply-unhappy-with-tsmc-claims-22nm-essentially-worthless,
outlining the issues they had with their foundry, TSMC. Particularly the cost per transistor did not decrease with
the 40nm to 28nm transistion. This was the first time that shrinking the process node yielded no economic benefit.
The implications are obvious. There is less economic incentive for developing new process nodes.

Intel's recent annoucement of a ~1 year delay to their 10nm architecture, Skylake, indicates that Moore's Law is at least severely strained.

Last year Intel's 14nm architecture, Broadwell, was also delayed by 6 months.
