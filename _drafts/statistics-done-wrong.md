[Statistics Done Wrong](http://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Done-Wrong-Woefully-Complete-ebook/dp/B00UMA61RE) is a great book by Alex Reinhart. The publisher [No Starch Press](http://www.nostarch.com/) was kind enough to send me a review copy.

Alex starts off on the cover page with my favorite quote from Feynman, "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the e3asiest person to fool." This is my all time favorite quote since it encapsulates more of the essence of science than anything else I've ever read.

In the introduction chapter I disagree with Alex's assertion that the problem with scientists & statistics is poor statistical education. I think the misalignment of incentives is more important. Modern academic scientists are /not/ rewarded for finding new knowledge that is /true/ but instead are rewarded for publishing.

I'm personally guilty of this in a paper on river flow forecasting, [Forecasting River Runoff through Support Vector Machines](/assets/icci2012_paper_revision_2.pdf). We used the best practices statistical methods e.g. independent training and test data sets. But I'm not confident that our results are true. Why didn't we continue investigating until we were certain our methods work? Because we wanted to publish! Publishing was the incentive.
